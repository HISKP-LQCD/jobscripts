genjobscripts is a jobscript and input file generator which takes

 * a jobscript template
 * template input files
 * a set of names for the executables to be called
 * a set of "basenames" which are part of the input filenames
 * a table "runtimes.dat" which gives the runtime 
   (IN HOURS) for NMEAS/NTIMES (e.g. 100) trajectories for a given 
   set of parameters corresponding to the executables and the basenames

 example:

 * executables: mpi,hybrid,serial
 * basenames: hmc0,hmc1,hmc2
 * jobtemplate.sh (see same directory for example for zeuthen batch system)
 * template input files: sample-hmc0.input, sample-hmc1.input, sample-hmc2.input
 * see runtimes.dat in this directory
